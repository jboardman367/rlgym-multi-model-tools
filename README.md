# rlgym-multi-model-tools
Tools for rlgym-tools for training multiple models at once, and training against other models

The example is basically just the example from rlgym-tools

## NOTE:
This is a _very_ early beta, it only works in 3v3 with one instance, 6 different models, and cannot shuffle the teams by itself.
